# 🧠 Context

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

This challenge aims to test your skills in analyzing and understanding spreadsheets and handling them from the [Googlesheet API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/concepts); as well as data interpretation and the ability to visually display for a layman end user.

The challenge is very simple, you must access the API and get some information (mentioned below) and then display it visually in the way you see fit. It can be creating a presentation, graphs, charts or whatever else you can imagine. Do it as creatively as you can.
